# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
#install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
#devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame
View(vehicles)

# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997
cars.from.1997 <- vehicles[vehicles$year == 1997,]

# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame
print(unique(cars.from.1997$year))

# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
two.wheelers <- vehicles[vehicles$drive == '2-Wheel Drive' & vehicles$cty > 20,]

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
worst.mpg <- two.wheelers$id[two.wheelers$hwy == min(two.wheelers$hwy)]

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
MostMPG <- function(year, make) {
  filtered.vehicles <- vehicles[vehicles$make == make & vehicles$year == year,]
  return(filtered.vehicles[filtered.vehicles$hwy == max(filtered.vehicles$hwy),])
}

# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
best.mpg <- MostMPG(1995, 'Honda')
